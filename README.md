# EVM Sniper

EVM Sniper is a text user interface (TUI) for managing Ethereum wallets and ERC-20 tokens. It allows you to add, remove and switch between wallets and add and remove ERC-20 tokens, as well as view token details and balances.

Planned features and goals:

- Buying and selling tokens
- "Sniping"
